# Machine Learning - Object Classifier and Pegasus Generator

Originally made for my university's Department of Computer Science's course _Software, Systems & Applications_ under the sub-module _Machine Learning_, as part of the coursework in 2018/2019.

This project has two main parts:
  1. The first part consists in building a [classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification) that generalises well for the [CIFAR-100](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset. There should be thorough experimentation in determining which architectures and optimisations to utilise.
  2. The second part consists in [generating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model) a colour image of a [Pegasus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegasus), training only on data from [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
